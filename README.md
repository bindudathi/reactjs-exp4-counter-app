This is a simple React + Vite project that demonstrates the use of the useState hook to build a counter application.

Users can increment and decrement the counter value.

The UI updates dynamically based on state changes.

This project was built as a learning experiment to understand React state management and component interaction.# reactjs-exp4-counter-app
